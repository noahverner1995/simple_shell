.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- Basic UNIX command interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
#include "holberton.h
.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a low-budget version of the original Shell.
.sp
.B Overview
.sp
As any low-budget program, it replicates a very limited but important set of commands from its original counterpart.
It reads the input of the user from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and hopefully executes them.
.sp
.B Invocation
.sp
If you want to activate the Interactive Mode, type "./hsh/" and then press Enter.
Else, to activate the Non-interactive Mode, type "echo "/bin/yourcommand" | ./hsh"
.sp
The Interactive Mode prompts and let you introduce your command first, then does its magic, to finally execute your command.
Letting you keep introducing more commands until you type "exit" or you run out of memory to allocate, whatever happens first.
.sp
The Non-interactive Mode, on the other hand, just executes your command and writes to the stdout the result of such execution.
In order to keep executing commands, you would have to retype "echo "/bin/yourcommand" | ./hsh".
